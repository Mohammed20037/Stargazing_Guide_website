            <h1>Hubble space telescope</h1>
        
            <p>Named in honor of the trailblazing astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope is a large, space-based observatory, which has revolutionized astronomy since its launch and deployment by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Far above rain clouds, light pollution, and atmospheric distortions, Hubble has a crystal-clear view of the universe. Scientists have used Hubble to observe some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as well as the planets in our solar system.</p>
            <P>Hubble’s capabilities have grown immensely in its over 30 years of operation. This is because new, cutting-edge scientific instruments have been added to the telescope over the course of five astronaut servicing missions. By replacing and upgrading aging parts, these servicing missions have greatly extended the telescope’s lifetime.</P>
            <P>Telescopes have a particular range of light that they can detect. Hubble’s domain extends from the ultraviolet through the visible (which our eyes see) and into the near-infrared. This range has allowed Hubble to deliver stunning images of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that have inspired people around the world and changed our understanding of the universe.</P>
            <P>Hubble has made more than 1.5 million observations over the course of its lifetime. Over 19,000 peer-reviewed science papers have been published on its discoveries, and every current astronomy textbook includes contributions from the observatory. The telescope has tracked interstellar objects as they soared through our solar system, watched a comet collide with Jupiter, and discovered moons around Pluto. It has found dusty disks and stellar nurseries throughout the Milky Way that may one day become fully fledged planetary systems and studied the atmospheres of planets that orbit other stars. Hubble has peered back into our universe’s distant past, to locations more than 13.4 billion light-years from Earth, capturing galaxies merging, probing the supermassive black holes that lurk in their depths, and helping us better understand the history of the expanding universe.</P>
            <P>In its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured humanity’s imaginations and deepened our knowledge of the cosmos. It will continue to do so for years to come.</P>
            <P>The Hubble Space Telescope explores the universe from Earth orbit. This vantage point allows it to obtain a view of cosmic objects unobstructed by Earth's atmosphere, which can distort light and block certain wavelengths.  </P>
            <P>NASA named Hubble after American astronomer <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/meet-edwin-hubble-in-a-hubble-25th-anniversary-video">Edwin P. Hubble</a> (1889–1953). Hubble confirmed an "expanding" universe, which provided the foundation for the Big Bang theory.</P>

                     <p>Looking at Hubble’s detailed images of cosmic splendors, it’s easy to forget that the telescope isn’t all that far away. Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit, which means it’s one of the satellites orbiting less than 1,200 miles (2,000 km) from the planet’s surface.</p>

                     <p>Hubble doesn’t need to be too far above Earth ― just far enough to be past Earth’s atmosphere, which blocks some wavelengths either partially or completely and distorts light from cosmic objects. When you look up at the sky at night and see the stars twinkling, you’re really seeing shifting pockets of air creating an effect called atmospheric distortion. It’s pretty, but it prevents earthbound telescopes from getting the kind of crystal-clear view that Hubble can achieve. Hubble’s low-Earth orbit also kept it within a safe and accessible range for astronauts, who used the space shuttle to visit the telescope repeatedly over the years to<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/index.html"> repair and upgrade its components.</a> </p>

                     <p>Hubble is currently located 332 miles (535 km) above Earth's surface. If you could drive straight up, you could reach it in about the same time it would take you to drive from Baltimore, Maryland to Boston, Massachusetts. Its orbit has been as high as 360 miles (579 km) over the years, but because it still endures some atmospheric drag, it slowly descends over time. To keep Hubble from gradually falling back toward Earth’s surface, the telescope was boosted into a slightly higher orbit multiple times over the years by the space shuttle following servicing.</p>



                     <ul>
                      <li>Hubble races through its orbit at about 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kph), completing an orbit about every 95 minutes. That means it sees 15 sunrises every day. </li>
                      <li>While Hubble is speeding around Earth, it can lock onto a target without deviating more than 7/1000th of an arcsecond, or about the width of a human hair seen at a distance of one mile. </li>
                      <li>Hubble has traveled over 4 billion miles (6 billion km) over its more than three decades in space. </li>
                      <li>Hubble has no thrusters. To change pointing direction, it uses Newton’s third law ― every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Hubble spins internal wheels weighing about 100 lbs (45 kg). When spun in a clockwise direction, the spacecraft itself will turn counterclockwise. The spacecraft turns at about the speed of a minute hand on a clock, taking about 15 minutes to turn 90 degrees. </li>
                      <li>Thanks to its technology and position above the atmosphere, Hubble can see astronomical objects with an angular size of 0.05 arcsecond, which is like seeing a pair of fireflies in Tokyo that are less than 10 feet (3 m) apart from Washington, D.C. </li>
                     </ul>

          <div class="tab">
            <h1>James webspace telescope</h1>
        
            <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) it is a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror. The telescope has been launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in 2021. </p>


        
            <p>
              The Webb telescope is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It is studying every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.
            </p>

            <p>The Webb telescope was formerly known as the "Next Generation Space Telescope" (NGST); it was renamed in September 2002 after a former NASA administrator, <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/faqs/whoIsJamesWebb.html"> James Webb.</a></p>

            <p>Webb is an international collaboration between <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, <a href="https://www.esa.int/">ESA (the European Space Agency)</a> , and the <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/">Canadian Space Agency (CSA) </a>. <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/">NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center </a> in Greenbelt, Maryland, is managing the development effort. The main industrial partner is <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/james-webb-space-telescope/">Northrop Grumman</a>; the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> will operate Webb after launch.   </p>


            <p>Several <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/technology.html">innovative technologies</a>  have been developed for Webb. These include a primary mirror made of 18 separate segments that unfold and adjust to shape after launch. The mirrors are made of ultra-lightweight beryllium. Webb's biggest feature is a tennis court sized five-layer sunshield that attenuates heat from the Sun more than a million times. The telescope’s four instruments - cameras and spectrometers - have detectors that are able to record extremely faint signals. One instrument <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nirspec.html">(NIRSpec)</a> has programmable micro shutters, which enable observation up to 100 objects simultaneously. Webb also has a cryocooler for cooling the mid-infrared detectors of another instrument <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/miri.html">(MIRI)</a> to a very cold 7 kelvins (minus 447 Fahrenheit) so they can work.</p>


            
            <h2><ul><li>WHY IS WEBB AN INFRARED TELESCOPE? 🤔</li></ul></h2>


            <p>By viewing the universe at infrared wavelengths Webb is now showing us things never before seen by any other telescope. It is only at infrared wavelengths that we can see the first stars and galaxies forming after the Big Bang. And it is with infrared light that we can see stars and planetary systems forming inside clouds of dust that are opaque to visible light.</p>

            <p>The primary goals of Webb are to study galaxy, star and planet formation in the universe. To see the very first stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe, we have to look deep into space to look back in time (because it takes light time to travel from there to here, the farther out we look, the further we look back in time).</p>

            <p>The universe is expanding, and therefore the farther we look, the faster objects are moving away from us, redshifting the light. Redshift means that light that is emitted as ultraviolet or visible light is shifted more and more to redder wavelengths, into the near- and mid-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum for very high redshifts. Therefore, to study the earliest star and galaxy formation in the universe, we have to observe infrared light and use a telescope and instruments optimized for this light.</p>

            <p>Star and planet formation in the local universe takes place in the centers of dense, dusty clouds, obscured from our eyes at normal visible wavelengths. Near-infrared light, with its longer wavelength, is less hindered by the small dust particles, allowing near-infrared light to escape from the dust clouds. By observing the emitted near-infrared light we can penetrate the dust and see the processes leading to star and planet formation.</p>

            <p>Objects of about Earth's temperature emit most of their radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths. These temperatures are also found in dusty regions forming stars and planets, so with mid-infrared radiation we can see the glow of the star and planet formation taking place. An infrared-optimized telescope allows us to penetrate dust clouds to see the birthplaces of stars and planets.</p>

            <p>Webb mission facts
              Launch mass: 6200 kg, including observatory, on-orbit consumables and launch vehicle adaptor
              </p>

              <p>The wavelength range covered by Webb's scientific instruments will be from about 0.6 μm to 28 μm (visible to mid-infrared light). By comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope observes at 0.1-2.5 microns (ultraviolet to the near infrared).</p>

              <p> Webb will have a segmented primary mirror with a diameter of 6.5 metres that will collect almost six times more light than the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

              <p>A giant, five layered shield protects the telescope and the instruments from the light and heat of the Sun. At 22 × 12 metres, this is about the size of a tennis court. The shield will keep the telescope and its instruments permanently in the shade where they will cool down to -233ºC.</p>

              <p>The mid-infrared instrument MIRI will be cooled down even further, to –266 °C by using an innovative cooling system</p>

              <p>Webb scientists have described packing a 6.5-metre telescope equipped with a sun-shield the size of a tennis court into a small rocket fairing with a diameter of five metres as “a bit like designing a ship in a bottle”.</p>


            

            <h2><ul><li>About the telescope</li></ul></h2>

            <p>Webb is the result of over 20 years of planning and development. Several elements make the space observatory unique and help ensure it will meet its objectives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Golden mirror:</li>
              <p>Webb's primary mirror is 6.5 metres wide, making Webb the largest space-based telescope ever built. The mirror is made up of 18 hexagonal gold-coated beryllium segments that can be adjusted individually.</p>

              <li>Sunshield:</li>
              <p>To protect itself from the Sun's heat, Webb has a tennis court-sized sunshield. One of Webb's instruments also has a refrigeration system to keep it cool, because the heat from the Sun (and Webb's own instruments) would otherwise interfere with the telescope's observations.</p>



              <li>Deployment:</li>
              <p>Webb is so large that it needed to be folded up like a piece of origami to fit into the Ariane 5 rocket that launched it into space. It took Webb about two weeks to fully unfold, and two more weeks to travel to its final destination.</p>



              <li>Instruments:</li>
              <p>In addition to the <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/jwst/canada-role.asp">Canadian-made scientific instrument NIRISS</a> , the Webb Telescope houses three other partner-contributed scientific instruments: </p>

            <h1>Kepler space telescope</h1>
            
            <p>The centuries-old quest for other worlds like our Earth has been rejuvenated by the intense excitement and popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. There is now clear evidence for substantial numbers of three types of exoplanets; gas giants, hot-super-Earths in short period orbits, and ice giants. The challenge now is to find terrestrial planets (i.e., those one half to twice the size of the Earth), especially those in the habitable zone of their stars where liquid water might exist on the surface of the planet.</p>

            <p>The Kepler Mission is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine the fraction of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy that might have such planets.</p>


            <h2><ul><li>Kepler Science</li></ul></h2>
            <p>The scientific objective of the Kepler Mission is to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. This is achieved by surveying a large sample of stars to:</p>

            <uL>
              <li>Determine the percentage of terrestrial and larger planets that are in or near the habitable zone of a wide variety of stars</li>
              <li>Determine the distribution of sizes and shapes of the orbits of these planets</li>
              <li>Estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems</li>
              <li>Determine the variety of orbit sizes and planet reflectivities, sizes, masses and densities of short-period giant planets</li>
              <li>Identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques</li>
              <li>Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.</li>

            </uL>
        
            <h2><ul><li>The Transit Method of Detecting Extrasolar Planets</li></ul></h2>

            <p>When a planet passes in front of a star as viewed from Earth, the event is called a “transit”. On Earth, we can observe an occasional Venus or Mercury transit. These events are seen as a small black dot creeping across the Sun—Venus or Mercury blocks sunlight as the planet moves between the Sun and us. Kepler finds planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front of it—we say the planet transits the star.</p>

            <p>Once detected, the planet's orbital size can be calculated from the period (how long it takes the planet to orbit once around the star) and the mass of the star using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The size of the planet is found from the depth of the transit (how much the brightness of the star drops) and the size of the star. From the orbital size and the temperature of the star, the planet's characteristic temperature can be calculated. From this the question of whether or not the planet is habitable (not necessarily inhabited) can be answered.</p>


            
            <h2><ul><li>Target Field of View</li></ul></h2>

            <p>Since transits only last a fraction of a day, all the stars must be monitored continuously, that is, their brightnesses must be measured at least once every few hours. The ability to continuously view the stars being monitored dictates that the field of view (FOV) must never be blocked at any time during the year. Therefore, to avoid the Sun the FOV must be out of the ecliptic plane. The secondary requirement is that the FOV have the largest possible number of stars. This leads to the selection of a region in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations of our Galaxy as shown.</p>

            
            <p>Learn more about the  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/overview/historybyborucki">history</a> of the mission from the account of Kepler visionary and principal investigator, William Borucki.</p>


            <h2><ul><li>Kepler's second mission: K2</li></ul></h2>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ends-attempts-to-fully-recover-kepler-spacecraft-potential-new-missions-considered/">loss</a> of a second of the four reaction wheels on board the Kepler spacecraft in May 2013 brought an end to Kepler's four-year science mission to continuously monitor more than 150,000 stars to search for transiting exoplanets. Developed over the months following this failure, the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..398H">K2 mission</a> represents a new concept for spacecraft operations that enables continued scientific observations with the Kepler space telescope. K2 became fully operational in May 2014 and is expected to continue operating until 2017 or 2018.</p>


            <p>Using the transit method to detect brightness changes, the K2 mission entails a series of sequential observing <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html">"Campaigns"</a> of fields distributed around the ecliptic plane and offers a photometric precision <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-observing.html#fine-point-photometric-precision">approaching that of the original Kepler mission</a> . Operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted on the spacecraft by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/ames/kepler-mission-manager-update-k2-has-been-approved">solar wind pressure</a> , reducing pointing drift to the point where spacecraft attitude can effectively be controlled through a combination of thrusters and the two remaining reaction wheels. Each campaign is therefore limited by sun angle constraints to a duration of approximately 80 days.</p>

            
            <h2><ul><li>Scientific motivations</li></ul></h2>

            <p>K2 is a community-driven mission. All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html">Guest Observer program</a> The scientific potential spans a wide range of astrophysics. It is anticipated that K2 will:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Provide a yield of hot planets around bright stars for follow-up transit spectroscopy to facilitate rapid advances in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.</li>
              <li>Provide a yield of small planets around bright, small stars to facilitate the most precise follow-up measurements to date of masses, densities and compositions.</li>
              <li>Identify locations and characteristics of potentially-habitable planets around bright M-dwarfs in the solar neighborhood.</li>
              <li>Determine if hot gas giants exist around young stars, or whether they migrate to small orbits at a later epoch by tidal or other interactions.</li>
              <li>Determine the relationship between stellar structure, rotation and activity within stellar associations over a range of ages and metallicity.</li>
              <li>Identify the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae from photometric structure in the rise to outburst maximum.</li>
              <li>Discover and characterize binary stars within open clusters and stellar associations.</li>
              <li>Characterize internal stellar structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of asteroseismology.</li>
              <li>Provide a large, regular cadence survey of AGN activity in the optical bandpass.</li>
              <li>Participate in multi-mission, multi-band monitoring campaigns of ecliptic targets along with other space-based hardware or ground-based telescopes.</li>
              
            </ul>


            <h2><ul><li>Spacecraft</li></ul></h2>

            <p>The Kepler spacecraft provides the power, pointing and telemetry for the photometer. Pointing at a single group of stars for the entire mission greatly increases the photometric stability and simplifies the spacecraft design. Other than the small reaction wheels used to maintain the pointing and an ejectable cover, there are no other moving or deployable parts The only liquid is a small amount for the thrusters which is kept from slosh by a pressurized membrane. This design enhances the pointing stability and the overall reliability of the spacecraft.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px;" class="font-weight-bold text-white text-justify">Planets are celestial bodies that orbit around a star, are spherical in shape, and have cleared their orbits of other debris. There are eight planets in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

              Exoplanets, on the other hand, are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. They are also known as extrasolar planets. The discovery of exoplanets has been one of the most exciting developments in astronomy in recent years, as it has opened up new opportunities to study the diversity of planetary systems beyond our own.
              
              One of the main differences between planets and exoplanets is the way they are detected. While planets in our solar system can be observed directly through telescopes, exoplanets are often detected through indirect methods, such as measuring the star's wobble caused by the planet's gravitational pull or observing the slight dimming of the star's light as the planet passes in front of it.
              
              Another significant difference is that exoplanets tend to be much more massive than the planets in our solar system. Many of them are so-called "super-Earths," which are several times the mass of our planet. Exoplanets can also have a wide range of characteristics, such as different sizes, temperatures, and atmospheres, which can provide insights into the conditions necessary for the formation and habitability of planets.</p>

        <h1>Solar System planets</h1>
    
        <p>The Solar System consists of eight planets orbiting around the Sun. Starting from the closest planet to the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2><ul><li>Mercury</li></ul></h2>
        <p> Is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. It 
          is a rocky planet and has a heavily cratered surface. Mercury has no atmosphere 
          and experiences extreme temperature variations. It has a very thin atmosphere 
          and no moons. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered due to its close proximity to 
          the Sun, which makes it vulnerable to asteroid impacts. It has a very slow rotation, 
          taking 59 Earth days to complete one rotation, but only 88 Earth days to complete 
          one orbit around the Sun.</p>


          <h2><ul><li>Venus</li></ul></h2>
          <p>It is the second planet from the Sun and is known for its thick, toxic 
            atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System. 
            Venus is a rocky planet and has a similar size and composition to Earth. It is 
            covered in clouds of sulfuric acid and has a rugged, volcanic surface. It is often 
            referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. Venus 
            has no moons and a very thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest 
            planet in the Solar System with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. 
            Venus also has a very slow rotation, taking 243 Earth days to complete one 
            rotation, but only 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.</p>

        <h2><ul><li>Earth</li></ul></h2>

        <p>It is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support 
          life. Earth is a rocky planet with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a magnetic 
          field that protects it from solar winds. It has a diverse range of ecosystems and a 
          complex geological history. It is the only planet known to support life, with a wide 
          range of ecosystems and a rich diversity of plant and animal life. Earth has one 
          large natural satellite, the Moon, which has played an important role in shaping 
          the planet's geology and climate.
          </p>



        <h2><ul><li>Mars</li></ul></h2>
        <p>It is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the "Red 
          Planet" due to its reddish appearance. Mars is a rocky planet with a thin 
          atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide. It has polar ice caps and 
          evidence of liquid water on its surface in the past, making it a prime candidate for 
          future human exploration. It has a thin atmosphere and a cold, dry, and rocky 
          surface. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and evidence of liquid 
          water in the past. Mars is also the site of several ongoing missions and future 
          planned missions to explore the planet's geology and potential for human 
          colonization.</p>




         <h2><ul><li>Jupiter</li></ul></h2>
         <p>It is the largest planet in the Solar System and is a gas giant with no solid 
          surface. It has a thick atmosphere that is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, 
          with colorful cloud bands and a Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been 
          raging for centuries. It is the largest planet in the Solar System and has a strong 
          magnetic field that traps radiation, making it a hostile environment for humans to 
          explore. Jupiter has over 80 known moons, including four large moons known as 
          the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>




          <h2><ul><li>Saturn</li></ul></h2>
          <p>It is the sixth planet from the Sun and is also a gas giant. Saturn is known 
            for its prominent and beautiful ring system, which is made up of ice particles and 
            rocks. It has a thick atmosphere with cloud bands similar to Jupiter's. It is known 
            for its prominent and beautiful ring system, which is made up of ice particles and 
            rocks. Saturn has over 80 known moons, with its largest moon Titan being the only 
            moon in the Solar System with a thick atmosphere and surface liquid.</p>




           <h2><ul><li>Uranus</li></ul></h2>
           <p> It is the seventh planet from the Sun and is an ice giant, which means it 
            has a small rocky core surrounded by a deep layer of ice and gas. Uranus is tilted 
            on its side, causing it to have an extreme axial tilt, resulting in unique seasons. It 
            has a highly tilted rotational axis, causing it to experience extreme seasons. 
            Uranus has 27 known moons, including the largest ones Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, 
            Titania, and Oberon.
            </p>



            <h2><ul><li>Neptune</li></ul></h2>
            <p>It is the eighth planet from the Sun and is also an ice giant. Neptune has 
              a similar composition to Uranus, but its atmosphere is much more active, with 
              powerful winds and massive storms. It is the farthest planet from the Sun and 
              takes the longest to orbit it. It is known for its active atmosphere, with powerful 
              winds and massive storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a storm system that was 
              first observed in the late 1980s. Neptune has 14 known moons, including its 
              largest moon Triton, which is the coldest known object in the Solar System with 
              surface temperatures of -235°C (-391°F).</p>



             <Ul>
              <li>Overall, each planet in the Solar System is unique and has its own set of 
                characteristics and features that make them fascinating objects to study and 
                explore</li>

        <h1>Exoplanets </h1>
    
        <p>Today, we are going to talk about something very special and exciting –
          exoplanets!</p>

        <p>
          So, first of all, what is an exoplanet? Well, you know how we live on planet Earth,
          right? Well, there are planets that exist outside of our Solar System that orbit
          around other stars! These planets are called exoplanets, which means planets
          outside of our Solar System.
         </p>

        <p>Now, let's imagine that we are traveling through space, and we come across a
          star. Do you know what a star is? It's like a big ball of gas that shines really bright
          in the sky. When we look at stars at night, they twinkle and glow, and they're
          really pretty!</p>

          in the sky. When we look at stars at night, they twinkle and glow, and they're
          really pretty!</p>


        <p>Now, exoplanets come in all shapes and sizes. Some are really big, like Jupiter,
          while others are small and rocky, like Earth. Some are really close to their star,
          while others are really far away.</p>
      
        <p>One really cool thing about exoplanets is that some of them are located in a
          special place called the habitable zone. This is the perfect distance from the star
          where it's not too hot or too cold, and there might be liquid water on the surface
          of the planet. You know how we need water to live? Well, scientists think that if
          there's water on an exoplanet, there might be living things there too!</p>

        <p>Scientists have discovered lots of exoplanets using special telescopes that can see
          really far into space. They look for changes in light or the wobbling of stars to tell
          if there might be an exoplanet there.
          So, that's a little bit about exoplanets! They're really amazing, and there's still so
          much we don't know about them. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be able to
          visit one ourselves!</p>

          <h2><ul><li>Here are some cool facts about exoplanets:</li></ul></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scientists estimate that there could be billions of exoplanets in our Milky
              Way galaxy alone!
           </li>
           <li>
            The smallest exoplanet discovered so far is only about the size of Earth's
            moon! 
           </li>
          <li>
            Some exoplanets have really weird names, like "Super Earth," "Hot Jupiter,"
            and "Mini Neptune." 
          </li>
          <li>
            Some exoplanets have more than one sun! They orbit around two stars
            instead of just one, like in the Star Wars movies. 
          </li>
          <li>
            There is even a planet that scientists think might be made out of diamond!
            It's called "55 Cancri e" and it's about twice the size of Earth. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The farthest exoplanet discovered so far is about 13,000 light-years away
f           rom Earth. That means it takes light 13,000 years to travel from there to
            here!
